# PSFree version 1.5.0

Lapse Kex ported to 9.00 - Still WIP

Very fast and reliable but can KP :P

Warning: This repository is a work in progress. Do not use it by default—or better yet, don’t use it at all—until I and/or someone else declare it stable. There are issues with certain games, such as black screens, problems with save data, and multiple kernel panics. The offsets for PS4 9.00 still need to be verified. If you choose to use it, do so at your own risk.

TODO:
- Needs a bin loader on Port 9020.
- Some performance Tweaks??.
  
PR are welcome 

PSFree is a collection of exploits for the PS4 console. The main focus of the 
repo is for the PS4 but we try to make things portable to PS5.
